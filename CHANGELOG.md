## 2026-09-09 — Frontend hardening, filter UX, and archive restructure

### 1. Inventory / pricing guards
- **Block backorder and zero-price products from purchase flows**
  - Added `isProductPurchasable`, `isValidPrice`, and `getEffectivePrice` helpers in `frontend/utils/price.ts`.
  - Guarded `addToCart` in `frontend/App.tsx` so backorder and invalid/zero-price products cannot be added to cart.
  - Updated `SingleProduct.tsx` Add to Cart / Buy Now buttons and click handlers to disable when the product is not purchasable.
  - Updated `ProductCard.tsx` `addWithPriceMode`, `handleQuickViewAddToCart`, and `handleQuickViewBuyNow` to use the same guard.
  - Filtered unpurchasable products out of `DealsSection.tsx` tab products and `hasAnyDeals`, and `TradeDeals.tsx` hand tools grid.
  - `BundlePanel.tsx` now filters out zero-price bundle candidates and adds selected valid items individually instead of showing an alert.

- **Hide out-of-stock products from shop and listings**
  - Filtered `fetchProducts()` and `fetchFeaturedProducts()` results in `frontend/App.tsx` via `isProductPurchasable`.
  - Filtered category-scoped and search-scoped products in `frontend/components/Archive.tsx` via `isProductPurchasable`.
  - This ensures `/shop`, category pages, search results, and featured grids exclude backorder / zero-price / out-of-stock items.

### 2. Archive sidebar and mobile filter panel
- **Removed Back Order Availability filter**
  - Removed `filterBackOrder` state and UI from desktop sidebar and mobile filter panel.
  - Removed backorder logic from `filteredProducts` computation and availability counts.

- **Fixed price filter behavior**
  - Desktop min/max inputs are now editable numeric fields with validation.
  - Added `parsePrice` helper that strips non-numeric input and clamps to valid bounds.
  - Range slider stays synced with inputs; inputs stay synced with slider via `useEffect`.
  - Added 300ms debounced URL persistence via `useSearchParams` (`price_min`, `price_max`).
  - Values clamp to catalogue bounds on blur.

- **Fixed sidebar scrollbar / divider**
  - Removed `sticky top-24 max-h-[calc(100vh-120px)] overflow-y-auto` from the sidebar container.
  - Sidebar now scrolls naturally with the page instead of creating a broken internal scroll area.

- **Added active filter chips + Clear all**
  - Added active filter chips bar above the product grid showing all active filters.
  - Chips include: In Stock, Deal types, Ranges, Colors, Brands, and Price range.
  - Each chip has an X that updates the canonical filter state.
  - "Clear all" button resets all filters including price range and sort.

- **Removed category/sale pills carousel**
  - Removed the category slider / pill section that appeared below the breadcrumb on the archive page.

- **Expanded mobile filter panel**
  - Added all desktop sidebar filters to the mobile filter drawer: Categories, Price, Availability, Current Offers, Brand, Range, Color.
  - Increased mobile filter panel z-index to `z-[1300]` so it appears above the sticky header.

- **Restructured archive toolbar layout**
  - Moved sort/filter toolbar above the sidebar+grid layout, spanning full width below the breadcrumb.
  - Toolbar now contains: product count, grid/list view toggles, mobile Filters button, and Sort by dropdown.
  - Breadcrumb section now has a `border-b border-gray-100` separator to match Checkers Category Hero style.

### 3. Header and navigation
- **Linked "Track Your Order" to `/track-order`**
  - Changed top bar "Track Your Order" from a button to a `<Link to="/track-order">`.
  - Changed account panel "Track Order" from a button to a `<Link to="/track-order">`.

- **Removed Help Center**
  - Removed "Help Center" link from the top bar utility menu.
  - Removed "Help Center" from the mobile menu "Help & Settings" section.

### 4. AI assistant removal
- Removed `BelimsChatbot` global mount and `AiAssistant` modal from `frontend/App.tsx`.
- Removed `isAiAssistantOpen` state, chatbot callbacks, and all related props from App.
- Removed "AI Helper" button from `frontend/components/Header.tsx` services panel.
- Components remain on disk but are no longer imported or rendered.

### 5. Vercel / build config
- Added `strictPort: true` to `frontend/vite.config.ts` to prevent Vite from drifting off port 3000, which is required by the WP CORS allowlist.

### 6. Fulfillment tiles redesign
- Redesigned `frontend/components/FulfillmentTiles.tsx` with a card-based pickup/delivery layout.
- Added expandable delivery options accordion with fastest/cheapest markers.
- Added hover animations and arrow swipe effects matching the CategoryGrid style.

### 7. Home page section order
- Moved `<CategoryGrid />` from the top of the home page to directly above `<DealsSection />`.
- Current order: HeroBanner → ShopByCategory → FeaturedGrid → CollageGrid → DealsSection → CategoryGrid → TradeDeals → PopularCategories.
