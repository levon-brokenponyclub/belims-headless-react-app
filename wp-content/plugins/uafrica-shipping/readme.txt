Use features like the address book and rule engine to customise your shipping processes to best suit your requirements. Bulk fulfillments, manifests and downloadable packing slips are also available for your convenience.

#__Manage the shipping rates you charge your customers at checkout__
__Rates at checkout__ is a Bob Go service that allows accounts to set up shipping rates that will be charged to their buyers at checkout. These rates will be configured based on certain criteria and can be set up for different service levels with other specific requirements. As an additional option, you can allow customers to select a collection locker or counter which will automatically be presented when a pickup location is available within their address radius.

== Installation ==

1. Log into your WordPress admin site.
2. Click on the “WooCommerce” tab and then “Settings”.
3. Click on “Advanced” in the tab, and then on “REST API” in the sub-menu.
4. Firstly, if Bob Go is already on your WooCommerce site, make sure it has READ/WRITE access.
__NOTE:__ Bob Go needs “Read/Write” access to ensure that order updates are sent back to your WooCommerce store.
5. If you do not have Bob Go on your WooCommerce site yet, click “Add key”.
6. A “Key Details” page will load:
In the “Description” text box, add __Bob Go__.
In the “User” box, select the default __admin user__.
In the “Permissions” box, select __Read/Write__.
7. Then click on the “Generate API key” button.
The consumer key and consumer secret will now be shown to you. You will need to copy these values and paste them into the relevant spaces in Bob Go. We highly recommend saving these values somewhere, as you might not be able to view them at a later stage.
8. Next, go to your WordPress Settings, select “Permalinks” and make sure “Post Name” is selected.
9. Once those settings are all activated, please copy the URL.
You must use your admin site URL to integrate your WooCommerce store to the Bob Go platform. You can find this by logging into your admin site and copying the URL from the address bar (it should NOT have /wp-admin/ in it).
10. On the Bob Go platform, click on the “Sales Channels” tab and select WooCommerce from the options on the screen.
11. Paste your WordPress admin site URL (copied in the previous steps) into the relevant fields and complete the WooCommerce installer on Bob Go to grant access to your WooCommerce store.
12. To ensure access, tick the box next to “Use alternative authentication method”.
